<p><b>Context:</b> According to the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/" type="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, an ambitious algorithm is one <i> â€œthat always takes the immediate, or local, best solution while finding an answer"</i>. Ambitious algorithms find the general or globally optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.</p>
