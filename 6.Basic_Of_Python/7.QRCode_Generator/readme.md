<h1>Simple QR Code generator</h1>
<p><b>TASK:</b> Create a simple python algorithm that receives as input a web link and return its QR Code image.</p>

<p><b>Rules:</b>
<ul>
<li>Use the qrcode library;</i>
</ul> 
</p><br>

<p><b>CONTEXT:</b> A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used for its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. The code consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The information encoded can be made up of any kind of data (e.g., binary, alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols).</p>

<p>As an example, using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/" alt="_blank">Pure python QR Code generator </a> it is easy to generate QR codes quickly, using pillow for generating images</p>

<p>Using the simpler code (qrCode), I generated - as an example - the QR Code below, that redirects to my Linkedin profile.</p>

<p>Using the more advanced code (qrCode2), I generated the QR Code below, using the same link as before.</p>
